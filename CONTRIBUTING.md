# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Adding content process

Each big topic is organized in its specific directory, where a `README.md` file has the structured list of papers.
The main `README.md`, place in the root of this repository, must have the table of content only.

Therefore, to contribute with new papers, please:

1. Find the topic where the paper best fit.
2. Write the structured entry for the record. 
   Currently, each record has its date, name, publication's title and repositories.
   1. Date is the date of publication
   2. Name is a common name used to refer to the record. For instance, the model or the dataset name. Not every paper has the model's name directly in its title. An example is PubMedBERT, which publication is entitled "Domain-Specific Language Model Pretraining for Biomedical Natural Language Processing".
   3. Publication is the publication's title. The title should be a link for the publication.
   4. Repositories contains links for available code, weights, dataset, downloable dataset, or any available content. Currently I have logos for GitHub and for HuggingFace repositories. Any other platform can be added as needed. Please follow the examples if you want to add a new asset.
   > Please note that the path for the github logo is slightly different in the topic's directory. Please, folow examples already available

   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
2. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
   Given a version = X.Y.Z, please, increment Z. 
   X is reserved for major releases and Y for minor release patches and the maintainers are responsible for incrementing those.
