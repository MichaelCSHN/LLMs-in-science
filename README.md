# Large language models and autonomous agents in chemistry: a review

Our review paper has, by no means, the goal of discussing the entire LLM/autonomous agents literature.
Instead, we propose a general discussion of these studies' trend topics, challenges, and potential for supporting scientific discovery.

Because artificial intelligence is a hot topic at the moment, and the daily number of new papers is just astonishing, any published review is fated to be outdated after a few months.
Therefore, we must maintain a systematic structure of the field with collaboration. 
With this in mind, we aim to create this repository as a broad, open-source, collaborative environment for organizing the large number of papers published daily.
